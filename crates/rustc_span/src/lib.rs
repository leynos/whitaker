#![feature(rustc_private)]

//! Re-exports the nightly `rustc_span` crate for lint scaffolding.
//!
//! Generated lint crates consume span utilities for diagnostics and reporting.
//! This wrapper forwards the entire upstream API through a workspace crate so
//! projects keep a consistent dependency surface.
