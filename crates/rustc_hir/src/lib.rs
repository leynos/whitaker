#![feature(rustc_private)]

//! Re-exports the nightly `rustc_hir` crate for lint scaffolding.
//!
//! This proxy crate exposes the upstream compiler crate so lint templates and
//! scaffolding code can integrate with the compiler without each generated
//! project reaching into unstable internals directly.
