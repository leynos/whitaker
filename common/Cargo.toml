# Testing: Behavioural specs pin rstest-bdd crates to 0.1.0 to stay aligned with
# the macro interface documented in `docs/rstest-bdd-users-guide.md`. Upgrade
# deliberately and rerun `make test` whenever upstream releases new behaviour so
# we can validate the scenarios before rolling them out across the suite.
