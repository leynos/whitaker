# Testing: Behavioural specs pin rstest-bdd crates to 0.1.0-alpha4 while we
# await a stable release. These alpha builds may regress; capture any failures
# with `make test` and report them via the troubleshooting guidance in
# `docs/rstest-bdd-users-guide.md`. Where blockers arise, coordinate with the
# maintainers to backport fixes or temporarily gate the affected feature tests.
