"""Fail a lane whose compiler cache is structurally broken, and warn on noise.

`scripts/record-sccache-effectiveness.sh` publishes sccache's statistics; this
reads the JSON it writes and decides whether the lane's cache integration is
working. A green build says nothing about that: sccache falls back to local
disk, or fails every store, and still compiles.

Three conditions fail the job, because each is a broken integration rather
than a bad day:

- the cache location is not the expected backend, so the server bound
  something other than the store the lane was configured for;
- sccache handled no compile requests, so it wrapped nothing;
- every store attempt failed, or every read did, which is the signature of an
  endpoint the server cannot use (Whitaker's runs 33748602187 and 33756048103
  failed 3,788 of 3,788 stores against GitHub's v2 service);
- write errors exceed `ERROR_RATE_LIMIT` of the store attempts, or lookup
  timeouts exceed it of the reads, which is an endpoint failing often enough
  that the lane is no longer cached in any useful sense, even though some
  operations still succeed.

sccache records a timed-out lookup as a miss, so timeouts are judged against
the reads, never the stores: a warm lane stores almost nothing, and one timeout
beside one store would otherwise read as a 100% failure. Read errors have no
rate of their own. sccache declares `cache_read_errors` but never increments
it; a failed read lands in `cache_errors`, beside compile errors that say
nothing about the cache, so no counter isolates it.

Isolated read errors, write errors, timeouts and cache errors are reported as
warnings. A proxy hiccup costs one compile, and turning it into a red pull
request would reintroduce the external-service failure that moving CodeScene
off the pull-request lane removed. The measured healthy rate is far below the
limit: the cold run 35672193433 had one write error and one timeout against
1,572 store attempts on `coverage-check` and 1,212 on `linux-full`, about
0.1%.

The script is stdlib-only and runs on the runner image's own `python3`; it
also declares itself a uv script so it can run the other way.
