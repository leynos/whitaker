"""Contract for the wiring of the shared CV-005 contract check.

The CV-005 clauses live in ``leynos/shared-actions`` (``cv005-contracts``) and
the library's own suite proves them. What the library cannot prove is that this
repository calls it: that the Makefile names a full commit, runs
``check --repository .`` under the Python the library needs, that
``.github/cv005.toml`` names this repository, and that CI runs it. Each of those
is read here by running ``make -n`` and parsing the workflow, so removing or
misspelling any of them fails a test.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
