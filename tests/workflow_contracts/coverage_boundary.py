"""What a pull-request-reachable workflow may not touch.

Pull-request CI generates `lcov.info` and compares it with the ratcheted
baseline derived from `main`. It does not publish that report as an artefact,
invoke the CodeScene coverage action, run a `cs-coverage` command, or carry the
credential either of those needs. Those belong to `coverage-main.yml`, which is
the only writer of persistent coverage state.

The coverage action archives the report it generated under a step of its own,
so declining that archive is part of the same boundary: a caller that reaches
the action without the opt-out has published the report whether or not the
workflow declares an artefact step. That rule is checked here rather than in
the workflow, because the action's own step is not the caller's to see.

These readers take a parsed document and its raw text rather than reading
files, so the contract beside them can drive shapes this repository does not
have. Parameterized over this repository's own workflows alone, a reader that
answered nothing would agree with a correct one exactly.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
