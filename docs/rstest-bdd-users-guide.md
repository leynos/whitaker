# `rstest-bdd` user's guide

## Introduction

Behaviour‑Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative practice that emphasizes
a shared understanding of software behaviour across roles. The design of
`rstest‑bdd` integrates BDD concepts with the Rust testing ecosystem. BDD
encourages collaboration between developers, quality-assurance specialists, and
non-technical business participants by describing system behaviour in a
natural, domain‑specific language. `rstest‑bdd` achieves this without
introducing a bespoke test runner; instead, it builds on the `rstest` crate so
that unit tests and high‑level behaviour tests can co‑exist and run under
`cargo test`. The framework reuses `rstest` fixtures for dependency injection
and uses a procedural macro to bind tests to Gherkin scenarios, ensuring that
functional tests live alongside unit tests and benefit from the same tooling.

This guide explains how to consume `rstest‑bdd` at the current stage of
development. It relies on the implemented code rather than on aspirational
features described in the design documents. Where the design proposes advanced
behaviour, the implementation status is noted. Examples and explanations are
organized by the so‑called *three amigos* of BDD: the business analyst/product
owner, the developer, and the tester.

| **Business analyst/product owner** | Writing and reviewing business-readable specifications; ensuring that acceptance criteria are expressed clearly.                  | Gherkin `.feature` files are plain text and start with a `Feature` declaration; each `Scenario` describes a single behaviour. Steps are written using keywords `Given`, `When`, and `Then` ([syntax](gherkin-syntax.md#L72-L91)), producing living documentation that can be read by non-technical stakeholders.                                                                                          |

A `#[scenario]` macro reads a feature file at compile time and generates a test that drives the registered steps. Fixtures whose parameter names match are injected automatically; use `#[from(name)]` only when a parameter name differs from the fixture.             |
| **Tester/QA**                      | Executing behaviour tests, ensuring correct sequencing of steps and verifying outcomes observable by the user.                    | Scenarios are executed via the standard `cargo test` runner; test functions annotated with `#[scenario]` run each step in order and panic if a step is missing. Assertions belong in `Then` steps; guidelines discourage inspecting internal state and encourage verifying observable outcomes. Testers can use `cargo test` filters and parallelism because the generated tests are ordinary Rust tests. |

The following sections expand on these responsibilities and show how to use the
current API effectively.

## Gherkin feature files

Gherkin files describe behaviour in a structured, plain‑text format that can be
read by both technical and non‑technical stakeholders. Each `.feature` file
begins with a `Feature` declaration that provides a high‑level description of
the functionality. A feature contains one or more `Scenario` sections, each of
which documents a single example of system behaviour. Inside a scenario, the
behaviour is expressed through a sequence of steps starting with `Given`
(context), followed by `When` (action) and ending with `Then` (expected
outcome). Secondary keywords `And` and `But` may chain additional steps of the
same type for readability.

Scenarios follow the simple `Given‑When‑Then` pattern. Support for **Scenario
Outline** is available, enabling a single scenario to run with multiple sets of
data from an `Examples` table. A `Background` section may define steps that run
before each scenario. Advanced constructs such as data tables and Docstrings
provide structured or free‑form arguments to steps.

### Example feature file

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping basket

  Scenario: Add item to basket
    Given an empty basket
    When the user adds a pumpkin
    Then the basket contains one pumpkin
```

The feature file lives within the crate (commonly under `tests/features/`). The
path to this file will be referenced by the `#[scenario]` macro in the test
code.

## Step definitions

Developers implement the behaviour described in a feature by writing step
definition functions in Rust. Each step definition is an ordinary function
annotated with one of the attribute macros `#[given]`, `#[when]` or `#[then]`.
The annotation takes a single string literal that must match the text of the
corresponding step in the feature file. Placeholders in the form `{name}` or
`{name:Type}` are supported. The framework extracts matching substrings and
converts them using `FromStr`; type hints constrain the match using specialized
regular expressions. If the step text does not supply a capture for a declared
argument, the wrapper panics with
`pattern '<pattern>' missing capture for argument '<name>'`, making the
mismatch explicit.

The procedural macro implementation expands the annotated function into two
parts: the original function and a wrapper function that registers the step in
a global registry. The wrapper captures the step keyword, pattern string and
associated fixtures and uses the `inventory` crate to publish them for later
lookup.

### Fixtures and implicit injection

`rstest‑bdd` builds on `rstest`’s fixture system rather than using a monolithic
“world” object. Fixtures are defined using `#[rstest::fixture]` in the usual
way. When a step function parameter does not correspond to a placeholder in the
step pattern, the macros treat it as a fixture and inject the value
automatically. The optional `#[from(name)]` attribute remains available when a
parameter name must differ from the fixture. Importing a symbol of the same
name is not required; do not alias a function or item just to satisfy the
compiler. Only the key stored in `StepContext` must match.

Internally, the step macros record the fixture names and generate wrapper code
that, at runtime, retrieves references from a `StepContext`. This context is a
key–value map of fixture names to type‑erased references. When a scenario runs,
the generated test inserts its arguments (the `rstest` fixtures) into the
`StepContext` before invoking each registered step.

### Step return values

`#[when]` steps may return a value. The scenario runner scans the available
fixtures for ones whose `TypeId` matches the returned value. When exactly one
fixture uses that type, the override is recorded under that fixture’s name and
subsequent steps receive the most recent value (last write wins). Ambiguous or
missing matches leave fixtures untouched, keeping scenarios predictable while
still allowing a functional style without mutable fixtures.

Steps may also return `Result<T, E>`. An `Err` aborts the scenario, while an
`Ok` value is injected as above. Type aliases to `Result` behave identically.
Returning `()` or `Ok(())` produces no stored value, so fixtures of `()` are
not overwritten.

```rust
use rstest::fixture;
use rstest_bdd_macros::{given, when, then, scenario};

#[fixture]
fn number() -> i32 { 1 }

#[when("it is incremented")]
fn increment(number: i32) -> i32 { number + 1 }

#[then("the result is 2")]
fn check(number: i32) { assert_eq!(number, 2); }

#[scenario(path = "tests/features/step_return.feature")]
fn returns_value(number: i32) { let _ = number; }
```

Example:

```rust
use rstest::fixture;
use rstest_bdd_macros::{given, when, then, scenario};

// A fixture used by multiple steps.
#[fixture]
fn basket() -> Basket {
    Basket::new()
}

#[given("an empty basket")]
fn empty_basket(basket: &mut Basket) {
    basket.clear();
}

#[when("the user adds a pumpkin")]
fn add_pumpkin(basket: &mut Basket) {
    basket.add(Item::Pumpkin, 1);
}

#[then("the basket contains one pumpkin")]
fn assert_pumpkins(basket: &Basket) {
    assert_eq!(basket.count(Item::Pumpkin), 1);
}

#[scenario(path = "tests/features/shopping.feature")]
fn test_add_to_basket(#[with(basket)] _: Basket) {
    // optional assertions after the steps
}
```

### Implicit fixture injection

Implicit fixtures such as `basket` must already be in scope in the test module;
`#[from(name)]` only renames a fixture and does not create one.

In this example, the step texts in the annotations must match the feature file
verbatim. The `#[scenario]` macro binds the test function to the first scenario
in the specified feature file and runs all registered steps before executing
the body of `test_add_to_basket`.

### Inferred step patterns

Step macros may omit the pattern string or provide a string literal containing
only whitespace. In either case, the macro derives a pattern from the function
name by replacing underscores with spaces.

```rust
use rstest_bdd_macros::given;

#[given]
fn user_logs_in() {
    // pattern "user logs in" is inferred
}
```

This reduces duplication between function names and patterns. A literal `""`
registers an empty pattern instead of inferring one.

> Note
> Inference preserves spaces derived from underscores:
>
> - Leading and trailing underscores become leading or trailing spaces.
> - Consecutive underscores become multiple spaces.
> - Letter case is preserved.

## Binding tests to scenarios

The `#[scenario]` macro is the entry point that ties a Rust test function to a
scenario defined in a `.feature` file. It accepts two arguments:

| Argument       | Purpose                                                                                                      | Status                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path: &str`   | Relative path to the feature file from the crate root. This is mandatory.                                    | **Implemented**: the macro resolves the path at compile time and parses the feature using the `gherkin` crate. |
| `index: usize` | Optional zero‑based index selecting a scenario when the file contains multiple scenarios. Defaults to `0`.   | **Implemented**: the macro uses the index to pick the scenario.                                                |

If the feature file cannot be found or contains invalid Gherkin, the macro
emits a compile-time error with the offending path.

The design document proposes a `name` argument to select scenarios by name, but
only `path` and `index` are currently accepted.

During macro expansion, the feature file is read and parsed. The macro
generates a new test function annotated with `#[rstest::rstest]` that performs
the following steps:

1. Build a `StepContext` and insert the test’s fixture arguments into it.

2. For each step in the scenario (according to the `Given‑When‑Then` sequence),
   look up a matching step function by `(keyword, pattern)` in the registry. A
   missing step causes the macro to emit a compile‑time error such as
   `No matching step definition found for: Given an undefined step`, allowing
   detection of incomplete implementations before tests run. Multiple matching
   definitions likewise produce an error.

3. Invoke the registered step function with the `StepContext` so that fixtures
   are available inside the step.

4. After executing all steps, run the original test body. This block can
   include extra assertions or cleanup logic beyond the behaviour described in
   the feature.

Because the generated code uses `#[rstest::rstest]`, it integrates seamlessly
with `rstest` features such as parameterized tests and asynchronous fixtures.
Tests are still discovered and executed by the standard Rust test runner, so
one may filter or run them in parallel as usual.

## Autodiscovering scenarios

For large suites, it is tedious to bind each scenario manually. The
`scenarios!` macro scans a directory recursively for `.feature` files and
generates a module with a test for every `Scenario` found. Each test is named
after the feature file and scenario title. Identifiers are sanitized
(ASCII-only) and deduplicated by appending a numeric suffix when collisions
occur.

```rust
use rstest_bdd_macros::{given, then, when, scenarios};

#[given("a precondition")] fn precondition() {}
#[when("an action occurs")] fn action() {}
#[then("events are recorded")] fn events() {}

scenarios!("tests/features/auto");
```

Generated tests cannot currently accept fixtures; use `#[scenario]` when
fixture injection or custom assertions are required.

## Running and maintaining tests

Once feature files and step definitions are in place, scenarios run via the
usual `cargo test` command. Test functions created by the `#[scenario]` macro
behave like other `rstest` tests; they honour `#[tokio::test]` or
`#[async_std::test]` attributes if applied to the original function. Each
scenario runs its steps sequentially in the order defined in the feature file.
By default, missing steps emit a compile‑time warning and are checked again at
runtime so steps can live in other crates. Enabling the
`compile-time-validation` feature on `rstest-bdd-macros` registers steps and
performs compile‑time validation, emitting warnings for any that are missing.
The `strict-compile-time-validation` feature builds on this and turns those
warnings into `compile_error!`s when all step definitions are local. This
prevents behaviour specifications from silently drifting from the code while
still permitting cross‑crate step sharing.

To enable validation pin a feature in your `dev-dependencies`:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
rstest-bdd-macros = { version = "0.1.0-alpha4", features = ["compile-time-validation"] }
```

For strict checking use:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
rstest-bdd-macros = { version = "0.1.0-alpha4", features = ["strict-compile-time-validation"] }
```

Steps are only validated when one of these features is enabled.

Best practices for writing effective scenarios include:

- **Keep scenarios focused.** Each scenario should test a single behaviour and
  contain exactly one `When` step. If multiple actions need to be tested, break
  them into separate scenarios.

- **Make outcomes observable.** Assertions in `Then` steps should verify
  externally visible results such as UI messages or API responses, not internal
  state or database rows.

- **Avoid user interactions in** `Given` **steps.** `Given` steps establish
  context but should not perform actions.

- **Write feature files collaboratively.** The value of Gherkin lies in the
  conversation between the three amigos; ensure that business stakeholders read
  and contribute to the feature files.

- **Use placeholders for dynamic values.** Pattern strings may include
  `format!`-style placeholders such as `{count:u32}`. Type hints narrow the
  match. Numeric hints support all Rust primitives (`u8..u128`, `i8..i128`,
  `usize`, `isize`, `f32`, `f64`). Floating-point hints accept integers,
  decimal forms with optional leading or trailing digits, scientific notation
  (for example, `1e3`, `-1E-9`), and the special values `NaN`, `inf`, and
  `Infinity` (matched case-insensitively). Matching is anchored: the entire
  step text must match the pattern; partial matches do not succeed. Escape
  literal braces with `{{` and `}}`. Use `\` to match a single backslash. A
  trailing `\` or any other backslash escape is treated literally, so `\d`
  matches the two-character sequence `\d`. Nested braces inside placeholders
  are not supported. Placeholders follow `{name[:type]}`; `name` must start
  with a letter or underscore and may contain letters, digits, or underscores
  (`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`). Whitespace within the type hint is ignored (for
  example, `{count: u32}` and `{count:u32}` are both accepted), but whitespace
  is not allowed between the name and the colon. Prefer the compact form
  `{count:u32}` in new code. When a pattern contains no placeholders, the step
  text must match exactly. Unknown type hints are treated as generic
  placeholders and capture any non-newline text greedily.

## Data tables and Docstrings

Steps may supply structured or free-form data via a trailing argument. A data
table is received by including a parameter annotated with `#[datatable]` or
named `datatable` of type `Vec<Vec<String>>`. During expansion, the
`#[datatable]` marker is removed, but the declared parameter type is preserved
and must implement `TryFrom<Vec<Vec<String>>>` so the wrapper can convert the
parsed cells.

A Gherkin Docstring is available through an argument named `docstring` of type
`String`. Both arguments must use these exact names and types to be detected by
the procedural macros. When both are declared, place `datatable` before
`docstring` at the end of the parameter list.

```gherkin
Scenario: capture table and docstring
  Given the following numbers:
    | a | b |
    | 1 | 2 |
  When I submit:
    """
    payload
    """
```

```rust
#[given("the following numbers:")]
fn capture_table(datatable: Vec<Vec<String>>) {
    // ...
}

#[when("I submit:")]
fn capture_docstring(docstring: String) {
    // ...
}

#[then("table and text:")]
fn capture_both(datatable: Vec<Vec<String>>, docstring: String) {
    // datatable must precede docstring
}
```

At runtime, the generated wrapper converts the table cells or copies the block
text and passes them to the step function. It panics if the step declares
`datatable` or `docstring` but the feature omits the content. Docstrings may be
delimited by triple double-quotes or triple backticks.

## Limitations and roadmap

The `rstest‑bdd` project is evolving. Several features described in the design
document and README remain unimplemented in the current codebase:

- **Selecting scenarios by name.** The README hints at a `name` argument for
  the `#[scenario]` macro, but the macro only accepts `path` and optional
  `index`.

- **Wildcard keywords and** `*` **steps.** The asterisk (`*`) can replace any
  step keyword in Gherkin to improve readability, but step lookup is based
  strictly on the primary keyword. Using `*` in feature files will not match
  any registered step.

- **Restricted placeholder types.** Only placeholders that parse via
  `FromStr` are supported, and they must be well-formed and non-overlapping.

Consult the project’s roadmap or repository for updates. When new features are
added, patterns and examples may change. Meanwhile, adopting `rstest‑bdd` in
its current form will be most effective when feature files remain simple and
step definitions are explicit.

## Assertion macros

When step functions return `Result` values it is common to assert on their
outcome. The `rstest-bdd` crate exports two helper macros to streamline these
checks:

```rust
use rstest_bdd::{assert_step_err, assert_step_ok};

let ok: Result<(), &str> = Ok(());
assert_step_ok!(ok);

let err: Result<(), &str> = Err("boom");
let e = assert_step_err!(err, "boom");
assert_eq!(e, "boom");
```

`assert_step_ok!` unwraps an `Ok` value and panics with the error message when
the result is `Err`. `assert_step_err!` unwraps the error and optionally checks
that its display contains a substring. Both macros return their unwrapped
values, allowing further inspection when required.

## Diagnostic tooling

`rstest-bdd` bundles a small helper binary exposed as the cargo subcommand
`cargo bdd`.

Synopsis

- `cargo bdd steps`
- `cargo bdd unused`
- `cargo bdd duplicates`

Examples

- `cargo bdd steps`
- `cargo bdd unused --quiet`
- `cargo bdd duplicates --json`

The tool inspects the runtime step registry and offers three commands:

- `cargo bdd steps` prints every registered step with its source location.
- `cargo bdd unused` lists steps that were never executed in the current
  process.
- `cargo bdd duplicates` groups step definitions that share the same keyword
  and pattern, helping to identify accidental copies.

The subcommand builds each test target in the workspace and runs the resulting
binary with `RSTEST_BDD_DUMP_STEPS=1` and a private `--dump-steps` flag to
collect the registered steps as JSON. Because usage tracking is process local,
`unused` only reflects steps invoked during that same execution. The merged
output powers the commands above, helping to keep the step library tidy and
discover dead code early in the development cycle.

## Summary

`rstest‑bdd` seeks to bring the collaborative clarity of Behaviour‑Driven
Development to Rust without sacrificing the ergonomics of `rstest` and the
convenience of `cargo test`. In its present form, the framework provides a core
workflow: write Gherkin scenarios, implement matching Rust functions with
`#[given]`, `#[when]` and `#[then]` annotations, rely on matching parameter
names for fixture injection (use `#[from]` when renaming), and bind tests to
scenarios with `#[scenario]`. Step definitions are discovered at link time via
the `inventory` crate, and scenarios execute all steps in sequence before
running any remaining test code. While advanced Gherkin constructs and
parameterization remain on the horizon, this foundation allows teams to
integrate acceptance criteria into their Rust test suites and to engage all
three amigos in the specification process.
