# Whitaker User's Guide

Whitaker is a collection of opinionated Dylint lints for Rust. This guide
explains how to integrate the lints into a project and configure them.

For contributors who want to develop new lints or work on Whitaker itself, see
the [Developer's Guide](developers-guide.md).

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

Install `cargo-dylint` and `dylint-link`:

```sh
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
```

### Standalone installation (recommended)

The simplest way to use Whitaker is via the standalone installer, which handles
setup automatically:

```sh
cargo install whitaker-installer
whitaker-installer
whitaker --all
```

This:

1. Installs `cargo-dylint` and `dylint-link` if not present
   The installer first attempts to download pre-built dependency binaries from
   Whitaker's GitHub Releases page for the current platform. If the release
   asset is absent (HTTP 404 or 410), the installer skips `cargo binstall` and
   falls back directly to building from source with `cargo install`, pinned to
   the version recorded in the dependency manifest. If the release asset is
   present but the download fails for another reason, the installer falls back
   to `cargo binstall` when available and then to `cargo install`. When the
   source-build path is taken, the installer reports that it is falling back to
   Cargo, and on success it prints
   `Installed <tool> from source with cargo install.`. After installation,
   `cargo-dylint` is verified by running `cargo dylint --version`, while
   `dylint-link` is verified by resolving the executable on `PATH` and then
   invoking it with `--help`. The installer sets `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` for that
   probe when needed, which avoids false failures from upstream
   `dylint-link --version` while still rejecting stale shims and broken scripts.
2. Clones the Whitaker repository to a platform-specific data directory
3. Builds the lint libraries
4. Creates `whitaker` and `whitaker-ls` wrapper scripts. `whitaker` invokes
   `cargo dylint` with the correct `DYLINT_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `whitaker-ls`
   lists installed Whitaker suite libraries
5. Ensures the pinned Rust toolchain and components are installed via rustup

After installation, run `whitaker --all` in any Rust project to lint it. Use
`whitaker-ls` to list the installed Whitaker suite libraries.

On Windows, the installer's `PATH` check honours `PATHEXT` and falls back to
the usual executable suffixes when `PATHEXT` is unset, so a normal
Cargo-installed executable such as `dylint-link.exe` in
`%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` is located correctly and then verified with the same
invocation-based probe without needing a separate wrapper or manual
environment-variable workaround.

**Options:**

- `--cranelift` — Install `rustc-codegen-cranelift` for the selected
  toolchain. `rustc-codegen-cranelift` is an alternative Rust compiler
  back-end based on the Cranelift code generator. It is not bundled with
  the standard nightly toolchain components and must be added explicitly via
  `rustup component add`. Use this flag when your project or CI environment
  requires the Cranelift back-end, or when a `rustc-codegen-cranelift`
  component add step would otherwise need to precede the installer invocation.
- `--skip-deps` — Skip `cargo-dylint`/`dylint-link` installation check
- `--skip-wrapper` — Skip wrapper script generation (prints
  `DYLINT_LIBRARY_PATH` instructions instead)
- `--no-update` — Don't update existing repository clone

### Adding Whitaker to a project

Add the following to the workspace `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.dylint]
libraries = [
  { git = "https://github.com/leynos/whitaker", pattern = "whitaker_suite" }
]
```

Then run the lints:

```sh
cargo dylint --all
```

### Version pinning

For reproducible builds, pin to a specific release tag or commit:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.dylint]
libraries = [
  { git = "https://github.com/leynos/whitaker", pattern = "whitaker_suite", tag = "v0.1.0" }
]
```

Or pin to a specific commit:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.dylint]
libraries = [
  { git = "https://github.com/leynos/whitaker", pattern = "whitaker_suite", rev = "abc123def456" }
]
```

### Rolling release downloads

Whitaker publishes a `rolling` pre-release tag that is continuously updated and
overwritten on every push to `main`. It is intended for early adopters who want
the latest available build outputs before the next stable release is cut.

Rolling releases are best-effort builds. If some matrix legs fail, Whitaker
still publishes the artefacts that were built successfully. For example, a
target-specific `cargo-dylint` archive may be missing from one rolling release
even though other target archives were updated successfully. Do not assume that
every supported target is present in every rolling release.

Stable releases differ from `rolling`: a stable tag is expected to contain the
complete artefact set for the release. For production installs, pin to a stable
release tag rather than consuming `rolling`.

If you consume rolling-release archives from scripts or CI, verify that the
required target archive exists before proceeding. Treat missing archives as an
expected condition for rolling releases rather than assuming the artefact set
is complete.

### Selecting individual lints

To load specific lints instead of the full suite, specify each lint explicitly:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.dylint]
libraries = [
  { git = "https://github.com/leynos/whitaker", pattern = "crates/module_max_lines" },
  { git = "https://github.com/leynos/whitaker", pattern = "crates/no_expect_outside_tests" }
]
```

### Standard vs Experimental Lints

Whitaker lints are divided into two categories:

- **Standard lints** are stable, well-tested, and included in the default suite.
  They are recommended for general use and have predictable behaviour.
- **Experimental lints** are newer or more aggressive checks that may produce
  false positives or undergo breaking changes between releases. They must be
  explicitly enabled.

The default `whitaker_suite` pattern includes only standard lints. At present,
all shipped Whitaker lints are standard and there are no experimental lints in
the release.

### Enabling experimental lints

#### Via standalone installer

```sh
whitaker-installer --experimental
```

This flag is retained for forward compatibility and currently has no effect.

## Lint Configuration

Configure lint behaviour in `dylint.toml` at the workspace root:

```toml
# Diagnostic language (default: en-GB)
locale = "cy"

# Module size threshold (default: 400)
[module_max_lines]
max_lines = 500

# Conditional branch limit (default: 2)
[conditional_max_n_branches]
max_branches = 3

# Custom test attributes
[no_expect_outside_tests]
additional_test_attributes = ["my_framework::test", "wasm_bindgen_test"]

# Additional test markers for `test_must_not_have_example`
[test_must_not_have_example]
additional_test_attributes = ["actix_rt::test", "my_framework::test"]

# Allow panics in main
[no_unwrap_or_else_panic]
allow_in_main = true
```

## Localized Diagnostics

Whitaker supports multiple languages for diagnostic messages. Set the locale
via the `DYLINT_LOCALE` environment variable or in `dylint.toml`:

```toml
locale = "cy"
```

Available locales:

- `en-GB` (default) - English
- `cy` - Welsh (Cymraeg)
- `gd` - Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig)

## Available Lints

### `bumpy_road_function`

#### Purpose <!-- bumpy_road_function -->

Detects functions with multiple distinct clusters of nested conditional
complexity.

#### Scope and behaviour <!-- bumpy_road_function -->

Flags a function when peak detection finds two or more separated complexity
regions above the configured threshold. Detection smooths the local complexity
signal with the configured `window` and only considers peaks spanning at least
`min_bump_lines`.

The default threshold was lowered from 3.0 to 2.5 to detect bumpy road patterns
in match expressions with nested conditionals. The moving-average smoothing
(window=3) reduces raw peaks by approximately 15–20%, so a threshold of 3.0 can
mask genuine two-bump patterns in match arms with nested `if` guards.

#### Configuration <!-- bumpy_road_function -->

```toml
[bumpy_road_function]
threshold = 2.5  # Raise to 3.0 or higher to reduce false positives
window = 3
min_bump_lines = 2
```

#### What is allowed <!-- bumpy_road_function -->

- A single complexity peak in a function.
- Simple predicates that remain below the configured threshold.

#### What is denied <!-- bumpy_road_function -->

- Two or more separated complexity peaks above the configured threshold.

#### How to fix <!-- bumpy_road_function -->

Split complex regions into helper functions and simplify branch-heavy
predicates.

______________________________________________________________________

### `conditional_max_n_branches`

Limits the complexity of conditional predicates by enforcing a maximum number
of boolean branches.

**Configuration:**

```toml
[conditional_max_n_branches]
max_branches = 2
```

The default threshold is 2 branches. A predicate like `a && b && c` has three
branches and would trigger the lint.

**How to fix:** Extract complex conditions into helper functions:

```rust
// Before: Too many branches
if condition_a && condition_b && condition_c {
    // action
}

// After: Extract to helper function
fn should_proceed() -> bool {
    condition_a && condition_b && condition_c
}

if should_proceed() {
    // action
}
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `function_attrs_follow_docs`

Ensures doc comments appear before all other outer attributes on functions.

**How to fix:** Move doc comments to appear before other attributes:

```rust
// Wrong
#[inline]
/// This function does something.
fn example() {}

// Correct
/// This function does something.
#[inline]
fn example() {}
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `module_max_lines`

Warns when modules exceed a configurable line count threshold.

**Configuration:**

```toml
[module_max_lines]
max_lines = 400
```

**How to fix:** Split large modules into smaller, focused submodules.

______________________________________________________________________

### `module_must_have_inner_docs`

Enforces that every module begins with an inner documentation comment (`//!`).

**How to fix:**

```rust
mod my_module {
    //! Explain the module's purpose here.
    pub fn value() {}
}
```

### `no_expect_outside_tests`

#### Purpose

Detect test attributes correctly so `no_expect_outside_tests` can allow
`.expect()` in recognized test-only code while still flagging production use.

#### Scope and behaviour

Whitaker recognizes `#[test]`, prelude-qualified `#[test]` forms,
`#[tokio::test]`, `#[async_std::test]`, `#[gpui::test]`, `#[rstest]`,
`#[rstest::rstest]`, `#[rstest_parametrize]`, `#[rstest::rstest_parametrize]`,
`#[case]`, and `#[rstest::case]` by default. The `additional_test_attributes`
setting extends that matching list with project-specific markers, so the lint
treats those annotated functions as tests too.

#### Configuration

```toml
[no_expect_outside_tests]
additional_test_attributes = ["my_framework::test", "wasm_bindgen_test"]
```

Set `additional_test_attributes` to an array of attribute paths written as
strings. Each entry should match the path Whitaker sees on the test function,
for example `my_framework::test` or `wasm_bindgen_test`.

#### What is allowed

- Default markers such as `#[test]`, `#[::test]`,
  `#[::std::prelude::v1::test]`, `#[tokio::test]`, `#[async_std::test]`,
  `#[gpui::test]`, `#[rstest]`, `#[rstest::rstest]`, `#[rstest_parametrize]`,
  `#[rstest::rstest_parametrize]`, `#[case]`, and `#[rstest::case]`
- Project-specific markers listed in `additional_test_attributes`, such as
  `#[wasm_bindgen_test]`

#### What is denied

Functions using `.expect()` will still be flagged when their test attribute is
not in Whitaker's default list and is not listed in
`additional_test_attributes`.

#### How to fix

- Add the missing test marker to `additional_test_attributes` if the function is
  genuinely part of a supported test framework
- Change the attribute usage to a recognized form such as `#[test]`,
  `#[::test]`, `#[::std::prelude::v1::test]`, `#[tokio::test]`,
  `#[async_std::test]`, `#[gpui::test]`, `#[rstest]`, `#[rstest::rstest]`,
  `#[rstest_parametrize]`, `#[rstest::rstest_parametrize]`, `#[case]`, or
  `#[rstest::case]` where appropriate
- If the function is not test-only code, replace `.expect()` with explicit error
  handling such as `?` or `map_err`

______________________________________________________________________

### `test_must_not_have_example`

Warns when test function documentation includes example headings (for example
`# Examples`) or fenced code blocks.

**Configuration:**

```toml
[test_must_not_have_example]
additional_test_attributes = ["actix_rt::test", "my_framework::test"]
```

Use `additional_test_attributes` for frameworks not covered by default test
markers such as `#[test]`, `#[tokio::test]`, `#[async_std::test]`,
`#[gpui::test]`, and `#[rstest]`.

**How to fix:** Keep test docs focused on intent and assertions, and move
example/tutorial snippets into user-facing documentation.

```rust
// Before
#[test]
/// # Examples
/// ```rust
/// assert_eq!(sum(2, 2), 4);
/// ```
fn sums_values() { /* ... */ }

// After
#[test]
/// Verifies summation handles two positive integers.
fn sums_values() { /* ... */ }
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `no_std_fs_operations`

Enforces capability-based filesystem access by forbidding direct use of
`std::fs` operations.

**Configuration:**

```toml
[no_std_fs_operations]
excluded_crates = ["my_cli_entrypoint", "my_test_utilities"]
```

The `excluded_crates` option allows specified crates to use `std::fs`
operations without triggering diagnostics. This is useful for:

- CLI entry points where ambient filesystem access is the intended boundary
- Test support utilities that manage fixtures with ambient access
- Build scripts or code generators that require direct filesystem operations

> **Note:** Use Rust crate names (underscores), not Cargo package names
> (hyphens). For example, use `my_cli_app` rather than `my-cli-app`.

**How to fix:** Replace `std::fs` with `cap_std`:

```rust
// Before
use std::fs;
fn read_config() -> std::io::Result<String> {
    fs::read_to_string("config.toml")
}

// After
use cap_std::fs::Dir;
use camino::Utf8Path;
fn read_config(config_dir: &Dir, path: &Utf8Path) -> std::io::Result<String> {
    config_dir.read_to_string(path)
}
```

### `no_unwrap_or_else_panic`

Denies panicking `unwrap_or_else` fallbacks on `Option`/`Result`, including
tests. Doctest runs remain exempt.

**Configuration:**

```toml
[no_unwrap_or_else_panic]
allow_in_main = true
```

**What is allowed:**

- Panicking `unwrap_or_else` fallbacks inside doctests
- Panicking `unwrap_or_else` fallbacks inside `main` when
  `allow_in_main = true`
- Non-panicking `unwrap_or_else` fallbacks

**What is denied:**

- `unwrap_or_else(|| panic!(..))`
- `unwrap_or_else(|| value.unwrap())`

**How to fix:** Propagate errors with `?` or use `.expect()` with a clear
message if a panic is truly intended. In tests, replace
`unwrap_or_else(|| panic!("msg"))` with `.expect("msg")` for clarity and
brevity.
